	/*
	 * You must implement the class Card.
• An object of the class Card stores a suit and a rank, both of type int.
• The class declares one constructor. It receives the initial value for the suit and the rank as parameters.
• Each object has two “getters”, getSuit and getRank, which returns the value of the suit and the rank, respectively.
• An object of the class Card has a method equals with a parameter of type Object. If the object designated by the
parameter is not of type Card, the method returns false, as these objects cannot be considered “equals”. Otherwise, the
method returns true if and only if the object designated by parameter is a Card that has the same suit and the same rank
